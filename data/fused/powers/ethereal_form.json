This will last for up to 10 seconds, but can be cancelled by pressing §ePrimary§r again; the subsequent cooldown will be twice as long as the time spent in §aEthereal Form§r.\nWithout your body, though, your range and damage are reduced by 50%, and any armor points are negated.\nHold §eJump§r while in a block to rise rapidly, or §eSneak§r to fall rapidly; hold §eJump§r midair to gain slow falling.\nBeing hit while this effect is active will cause you to return to your normal form, and the cooldown will be 1.5 seconds longer.\n§a[This power is affected by Magic Energy; for every missing point of Magic Energy, the maximum duration of this effect is decreased by 0.5 seconds and the cooldown is increased by a static 0.5 seconds]",
